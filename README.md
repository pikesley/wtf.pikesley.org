#sam.pikesley.org

I write code and play music. Some places you can find me on the web:

* My [Github](https://github.com/pikesley) account
* My [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pikesley) stream
* My [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pikesley/) page
* My lovely employers, the [Open Data Institute](http://theodi.org/team/sam-pikesley)
* My terribly neglected [blog](http://org.orgraphone.org/)
* My [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/pikesley) and [my band's](https://soundcloud.com/rawfunkmaharishi)
* My very patchy [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/pikesley/videos) channel

And some things I have made (several of which are on Heroku, so have probably gone to sleep, please be patient while they wake up):

* [Pancreas API](http://pancreas-api.herokuapp.com/): Just because my pancreas is broken, doesn't mean it can't have a RESTful API
* [Diabetes Dashboard](http://pikesley.github.io/diabetes-dashboard/): Dashing dashboard fed by the Pancreas API
* [Badger](http://pikesley.github.io/badger/): Generate Github project badges like a boss
* [Uncle Clive](http://uncleclive.herokuapp.com/): Sinclair Spectrum font as a Service
* [Pokrovsky](http://pokrovsky.herokuapp.com/): Github History Vandalism as a Service
* [What is DevOps?](http://whatisdevops.com/)
* [How fucked is the climate?](http://howfuckedistheclimate.com/)
* [Is Michael Gove wrong?](http://ismichaelgovewrong.info/)
